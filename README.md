# Aim
- This project aims to expose people who want to learn about current events to less biased content.
- I plan to learn more about Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics while tackling the problem of scoring articles based on how opinionated/ biased they may be.

# Initial Inspiration
- I started with a Fake vs Real news classifier which I worked on for my intro to Machine Learning course at University,

# Project structure
## Research
The Research folder consists of my learning process of developing and picking models that might be the best fit to tackle this problem.
## Development
The Development folder consists of the Web App I am building so that others can use it.
