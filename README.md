# Aim
- This project aims to enable people browse the internet while being aware of inherent biases in content.
- I plan to learn more about Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics while tackling the problem of scoring articles based on how opinionated/ biased they may be.

# Initial Inspiration
- Projects from ML / NLP courses at University: Fake vs real news detection, identifying political bias on reddit

# Project structure
## Research
The Research folder consists of my learning process of developing and picking models that might be the best fit to tackle this problem.
## Development
The Development folder consists of the Web App I am building so that others can use it.
